This script converts a phonebook.ib file generated by a Nokia 235 (4G) backup, printing the data to stdout.

Created and tested ad-hoc on a single sample file

This version is tested only with Nokia 235 4G phonebook.ib files.

# Important
These scripts are based on reverse engineering methodology, reading the phonebook.ib file using a hexadecimal editor (Okteta).

They are ugly and messy, but they work (at least for me!).

Feel free to open a issue if you need to ask a modify according to your tests and/or your phonebook.ib

# Usage
Open the file(s) and modify the prefix

Execute: 
``python extract_nokia_phonebook.ib_handmade.py phonebook.ib``

# Note
Like you can see, there are two file:
- extract_nokia_phonebook.ib_handmade.py
- extract_nokia_phonebook.ib_chatgpt.py

To play, I asked ChatGPT to improve my file.
_chatgpt is the version of the file created by ChatGPT, to which I fed my own file, requesting cleanup and comments.
